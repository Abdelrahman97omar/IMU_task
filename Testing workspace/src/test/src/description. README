Actuall_angle code:
        it's a node that subscribes to "slamware_ros_sdk_server_node/odom" topic from the robot
        and save the angles readings into a yaml file

actuall_base_acc code:
        This code subscribes to "/wheel_speeds" topic to receive the wheel speeds in m/s
        and save the time and velocities differences between each two publishes to 
        calculate acceleration

Actuall_rotation_speed code:
        This code subscribes to "/wheel_speeds" and calculate the rotational velocity of the
        robot
